# PurpleSensor

This package provides the interface to a purple air sensors from Swift and ObjC returning
the name of the sensor, humidity, temperature, pressure, and the air quality index (
current value and several types of running averages).

The sensor to take the reading from is identified by two values:
    device ID ("ID" in the JSON)
   Thinkspeak primary id read key ("THINGSPEAK_PRIMARY_ID_READ_KEY" in JSON)
    
These values can be obtained from purple air map, where you context click on the sensor,
scroll to the button of the pop-up where it says "Get This Widget".  Clicking on this gives
another pop-up menu where you can click JSON which shows the fields.

For example  "79963" is the device ID of the saratoga swim club's sensor, and "PLAU2B5XC0FSICZR"
is the thinkspeak primary id read key.  These can be modified for the particular sensor you 
want to use.

The interface is pretty easy to use, in that you conform to the protocol, and call the
performRequest(id: String, thinkspeakKey: String).

When the update is finished the protocol method
    didUpdatePurple(_ purple: PurpleModel), or 
    func didFailWithError(_ error: Error)

are called.  The data is returned in an object of PurpleModel which has properties for 
each of the sensor values.

The library can be used by swift programs or objective-c programs.

## Swift Programs Example


```
import UIKit
import PurpleSensor

class ViewController: UIViewController, UpdatePurpleDelegate {

    
    
    var purpleManager = PurpleManager()
    
    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        // Do any additional setup after loading the view.
        
        purpleManager.delegate = self
        purpleManager.performRequest(id: "79963", thinkspeakKey: "PLAU2B5XC0FSICZR")
    }
    
    func didUpdatePurple(_ purple: PurpleModel) {
        print("purple location: \(purple.name)")
        print("humidity: \(purple.humidity) %")
        print("temperature: \(purple.temp) F")
        print("pressure: \(purple.pressure) millibars")
        print("air quality: \(purple.PMcurrent) ")
        print("AQ: \(purple.AQ)")
        print("AQ Description: \(purple.AQDescription)")
        print("AQ Message: \(purple.AQMessage)")
        
        print("AQ10min: \(purple.AQ10min)")
        print("AQ10min Description: \(purple.AQ10minDescription)")
        print("AQ10min Message: \(purple.AQ10minMessage)")
        
        print("AQ30min: \(purple.AQ30min)")
        print("AQ30min Description: \(purple.AQ30minDescription)")
        print("AQ30min Message: \(purple.AQ30minMessage)")
        
        print("AQ1hr: \(purple.AQ1hr)")
        print("AQ1hr Description: \(purple.AQ1hrDescription)")
        print("AQ1hr Message: \(purple.AQ1hrMessage)")
        
        print("AQ6hr: \(purple.AQ6hr)")
        print("AQ6hr Description: \(purple.AQ6hrDescription)")
        print("AQ6hr Message: \(purple.AQ6hrMessage)")
        
        print("AQ24hr: \(purple.AQ24hr)")
        print("AQ24hr Description: \(purple.AQ24hrDescription)")
        print("AQ24hr Message: \(purple.AQ24hrMessage)")
        
        print("AQ1week: \(purple.AQ1week)")
        print("AQ1week Description: \(purple.AQ1weekDescription)")
        print("AQ1week Message: \(purple.AQ1weekMessage)")
        
    }
    
    func didFailWithError(_ error: Error) {
        print("Error \(error.localizedDescription)")
    }
}
```
